%% Abstract

This paper addresses a method of adaptive body orientation control for quadruped robots mobilized
using open-loop gait control methods, such as Central Pattern Generators (CPG). The controller at
hand is based on a feed-foward, inverse dynamics routine. Controller adaption is achieved using a 
Nonlinear Autoregressive eXogenous (NARX)-model Neural Network -- a recurrent neural network
architecture typically utilized for modeling nonlinear difference systems. Here, the NARX Network is
utilized to make predictions about the system dynamics, which are assumed to be periodic during
the execution of a cyclic gait. Furthermore, the controller serves as an on-line method for
learning and canceling disturbances imparted upon angular trunk states. This control method
is particularly applicable to legged systems which articulate trunk-mounted vision sensors, such
as cameras and laser range-finders, by reconfiguring thee kinematic state of the trunk
while executing a gait sequence. By canceling trunk distrubances, the fidelity of vision
sensors meausurements can be enhanced by removing noise before it propogates to the aforementioned
sensor units.

%These state predictions are then combined with known feedback signals to approximate the robot's
%dynamics during gaiting. signals are combined with reference trajectories for each foot through an inverse kinematic routine, which is then used to update joint position commands supplied to each independent joint controller.
